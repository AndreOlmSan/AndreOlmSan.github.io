My portfolio website

Disclaimer: I'm sorry if you happen to look over this code while it is still in early its early stages, it is very messy.
As they say, it gets the job done. There will be regular updates on the source code to make sure the website stays up to date. 

Resources I used to make this site:

Inspired by: https://jgabriel.eu/

https://logodix.com/ - logos

https://freefrontend.com/ - useful templates

https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples - box shadow templates
